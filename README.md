Includes particle-based simulation and analysis code corresponding to Fig. 3 and Fig. S2.

Simulations were conducted using Smoldyn v2.58 on the UNC Longleaf compute cluster. Individual simulations can be run on a local machine, but obtaining the number of realizations desired (n=300 main text; n=30 supplement) required distribution of the simulations across multiple CPUs. Large files (primarily simulation outputs) are excluded due to storage limitations, but data is available upon request.
